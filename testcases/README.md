# Test Cases

These simple test cases are used to test the functionalities of the compiler.<br>
The functionalities tested by each of the test case is mentioned as a comment inside the program.

The errors checked for include :
- Unbalanced Braces
- Unbalanced parantheses
- Unbalanced angular brackets
- Incorrect quotes / Strings
- Improper nested loops
- Improper conditional statements

The functionalities currently supported are mentioned in the README in root directory.

**NOTE**<br>
- The test cases have been overly simplified to make sure we lay more stress on the compiler's functionalities rather than on the input program itself.
- The test cases do not exhaustively cover all the functionalities of the compiler.
