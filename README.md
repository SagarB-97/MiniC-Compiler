A compiler for a subset of C language
</br></br>
Lex helps write programs whose control flow is directed by instances of regular expressions in the input stream. It is well suited for editor-script type transformations and for segmenting input in preparation for a parsing routine.
Using Lex we will design a lexical analyser for a subset of the C language.
- It will support nested while loops.
- It will support the char and int datatype and its subtypes (short, long, default). 
- It will read the character stream and return the appropriate tokens types. 
- It will recognise keywords supported by the C language. 
- It will support nested comments. 
- Appropriate error messages will be returned.
- With the help of hash tables, symbol and constants table will be generated and maintained.
- Functions scanning will be supported.
- Error checking like unending strings, comments will be taken care of.
- The scanner output will be presented in accordance with the guidelines provided in the course plan.
- Most of the C operators will be supported
